To keep our packages standardised and prevent conflicts, we will be using python 3.9 and the packages in the requirements.txt file. 
If you come across a version conflict or used a new package, please update the requirements.txt file accordingly :)

Creating virtual environment:
(in cmd)
conda create -n <name> python=3.9
conda activate <name>

conda deactivate  (close the environment)

pip install -r requirements.txt (quickly install all used packages, may result in conflict, in which case manually install)
