# Singapore Sign Lanaguage (SSL) recognition.

# Introduction
This project aims to harness the capabilities of computer vision models to bridge communication gaps by interpreting Singapore Sign Language. This initiative addresses the widespread issue of a significant portion of the population facing challenges in understanding sign language.

# Project Goals
- Develop computer vision models for recognizing and interpreting Singapore Sign Language.
- Tackle the communication barrier by providing a solution for the majority of the population unfamiliar with sign language.
- Foster inclusivity and create a more connected society.
# How It Works
Our system employs advanced computer vision techniques to seamlessly recognize and interpret Singapore Sign Language gestures. This project is not just about technology; it's about building a tool that enhances communication and promotes inclusivity in our community.
